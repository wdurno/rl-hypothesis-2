## Notes

Special thanks to [`shadowyzy`](https://github.com/shadowyzy) for posting MineRL deep learning code, available [here](https://github.com/shadowyzy/NIPS2019-MineRL-Competition-solution). This code served as my initial model design. Discovering decent model code is very time consuming, so has accelerated my work.
